# Module_14_JAVA
Hello! Please find my JavaScript Assignment submission in this repository.

Inspecting the website contents where the data was proved to be very helpful with understanding the assignemnt and the goals that were to come from it. Once I had a good grasp on that, I had a better idea of how to design my functions and implement them on the data.

My tutor, Justin, helped me breakdown the assignment and the layout of the code a little different than what was provided in the starter code, but it helped organize my functions in a way more logical to me.

I utilized code templates from the module activities and additional code templates that Dave sent to us throughout the module. I used internet searches to find code examples when needed. 

I found this to be a really interesting assignment that took into account a lot of the skills we learned in the module, including user interaction. 

Thanks!
